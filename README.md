sangrenel
=========

*"...basically a cloth bag filled with small jagged pieces of scrap iron"*

Note Dec 2016: Sangrenel is awfully out of date and could be a much better tool. It will be revived soon with new features, improvements and much needed refactoring.

### Installation

NOTE: Sangrenel locally vendors v1.8.0 of Sarama (the Go Kafka client library), which builds properly with Sangrenel - but the functionally with this version has not been extensively tested.

Assuming Go is installed (tested with 1.6, 1.7) and $GOPATH is set:

- `go get -u github.com/jamiealquiza/sangrenel`
- `go install github.com/jamiealquiza/sangrenel`

Binary will be found at `$GOPATH/bin/sangrenel`

### Overview

Smashes Kafka queues with lots of messages and reports performance metrics (to console and optionally, Graphite). Used in my Kafka on AWS load testing [blog post](https://grey-boundary.io/load-testing-apache-kafka-on-aws/). While using this tool, keep in mind that any benchmarking scenario is an examination of total systems performance and that the testing software itself is part of the system (meaning you're not just testing Kafka, but Kafka+Sangrenel).

Usage overview:

<pre>
% ./sangrenel -h
Usage of ./sangrenel:
  -batch=0: Max messages per batch. Defaults to unlimited (0).
  -brokers="localhost:9092": Comma delimited list of Kafka brokers
  -clients=1: Number of Kafka client workers
  -compression="none": Message compression: none, gzip, snappy
  -graphite-ip="": Destination Graphite IP address
  -graphite-metrics-prefix="random": Top-level Graphite namespace prefix (defaults to hostname)
  -graphite-port="": Destination Graphite plaintext port
  -noop=false: Test message generation performance, do not transmit messages
  -producers=5: Number of producer instances per client
  -rate=100000000: Apply a global message rate limit
  -size=300: Message size in bytes
  -topic="sangrenel": Topic to publish to
</pre>

The <code>-clients</code> directive initializes n Kafka clients. Each client manages 5 Kafka producer instances (overridden with <code>-producers</code>) in goroutines that synchronously publish random messages of <code>-size</code> bytes to the referenced Kafka cluster/topic as fast as possible. Kafka client worker counts need to be scaled up in order to produce more throughput, as each client connection maxes out throughput with roughly 5 producers instances. Configuring these variables allows you to roughly model arbitary topologies of connection counts and workers per connection. The <code>-rate</code> directive allows you to place a global cap on the total message rate for all workers combined.

Note: Sangrenel should be tested with <code>--noop</code> (messages are only generated but not transmitted to the brokers) in order to determine the maximum message rate that the configured message size and worker setting can generate. Otherwise, you may see a throughput rate that's computationally bound versus the actual limitation of the Kafka brokers being testing.

If a topic is referenced that does not yet exist, Sangrenel will create one with a default of 2 partitions / 1 replica (or as defined in your Kafka server configuration). Alternative parition/replica topologies should be created manually prior to running Sangrenel.

Sangrenel outputs metrics based on the previous 5 seconds of operation: the aggregate amount of data being produced, message transaction rate (or generated rate if using <code>--noop</code>) and top 10% worst latency average (time from message sent to receiving an ack from the broker).

If optionally defined, Graphite can be used as a secondary output location. This allows you to graph performance results in addition to overlaying Sangrenel metrics against Kafka cluster metrics that you may already be collecting in Graphite.
